### Projects

#### Course Grade Calculator
- This project involved making a usable program that calculates and displays course
grades using quiz and assessment scores, calculating also both unweighted and
weighted averages, with correct Python 3 coding.

***

 > **Initial project idea:**
Week 8 Module 10 Assessment 10 was an assigned assessment. It was a course
grade calculator, and I felt it was best to keep my structure of Python 3 code the
same as it was listed in the input requirements. I set out to solve the problem of
creating a course grade evaluator and having clear input so my output would work
without any errors. This problem needed to be solved because without it, my code
wouldn’t run smoothly. 

> **Tools I used:** 
I used the tools of JDoodle and my notes from the class lecture to complete this project.

> **Challenges I faced:**
I faced the challenge of my grade calculation code because of outside tutorial sources I used giving me the “def” coding word, which is considered a function to use for my calculation based on user output being entered from my input coding. I had to revert to using an if/else statement string to evaluate the grade calculations like how we used in other examples in class. 

> **Other Resources:** 
I used YouTube to help me with doing causation within the coding of the course grades. I had trouble trying to figure out how to have each quiz and assessment number
grade be processed in coding in the output as a letter grade. I watched a YouTube
tutorial on how to do that in Python coding. 

> **Result:**
I set out to achieve getting a 100 on this assignment and completing all my coding correctly so that my input ran properly and used the user’s output to address and show a proper analysis of their course grades. Some improvement I would make to get an overall average of their complete grade would be to include grade scores on homework as well to be factored in.

#### Creating Student Transcripts
- This project involved creating a student table and grade table, taking two students’ information from both with queries that include
their personal with course and grade information, and creating a report transcript
for the students that includes semester averages, grades, and overall GPA in PDF
form.

***

> **Initial project idea:**
Week 12 Module 15 Assessment had instructions to use Access to create student transcripts. I set out to solve the problem of using tables and the relationship between them to compile a transcript displaying all the data from two specific students. This problem needed to be solved in order to completely fulfill all the instructions listed.

> **Tools I used:** 
I used the Apporto Virtual Lab Link and Microsoft Access platform as tools to complete this project. I faced the challenge of making the correct relationship between the queries created of the two students whose grades I was pulling and the tables I made containing the data. I had to refer back to the previous assignment to remember how I did it. 

> **Challenges I faced:**
It was also a challenge to get enough class and course codes, but I used the Loyola course catalog to get them. 

> **Other Resources:** 
I used a YouTube tutorial as a resource to figure out how to add the total GPA to the transcript report filled with the data of two students’ grades and information. I
also used the video lecture 15.2 provided on Moodle to help guide me through
completing and creating these student transcripts. 

> **Result:**
I set out to achieve the result of having a full transcript filled with student course name, semester, and class along with grades that correspond in order. I would make the improvement of just trying different layouts of the transcript provided on Access. I just used the one the tutorial video showed me.

#### Excel Side Business
- This project involved adding to my Excel side business data sheet system using the VLOOKUP function to calculate item totals, loan payments over specific years listed in instructions, and determining if it's affordable and total interest paid based on the business's budget.

***

> **Initial project idea:**
Week 6 Module 8 Assessment 8 for this I came up with a sneaker side business,
and this project expanded on it. I came up with sneakers because it's a popular purchase among all people. I set out to solve the problem of adding existing data to my business and connecting it with data I've accumulated from other assessments. I needed to solve the problem of adding loan information and connecting the data using VLOOKUP. I set out to solve this problem using class to learn how to use the function to replicate my data to be used again and pulled up
from the duplicated table. 

> **Tools I used:** 
I used the tools of Microsoft Excel to complete this project. 

> **Challenges I faced:**
I faced the challenge of having my numbers being red, not knowing that meant negative answers. 

> **Other Resources:** 
I used the class Discord for help and was able to figure out how to do the calculations
properly and get the correct amounts with the data I was using. I had some help from my classmates and the class lecture for this assignment on what math equations I needed, whether division, multiplication, or simple addition or subtraction was needed. 

> **Result:**
I set out to achieve making my layout creative and using Excel functions to calculate the data properly, and I believe I did achieve this. I would probably have changed the structure, making it a scroll-down instead of scroll-to-the-side appearance so that viewing all the data would be easier to see all at once.
